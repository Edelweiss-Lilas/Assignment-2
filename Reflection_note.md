The DTD file is simpler to create because it is a personalisation of the things or objects I want to encode or annotate, compared to the TEI_all file, where we have to respect a hierarchy and the logic behind it.  With the TEI file we encode more details in the <header>. In the <tei header>, we could put metadata that we could see directly on the front page and also the information that we could find on the Gallica website, which helps to understand which information came from whom. The <sourceDesc>,the <msDesc> and the <history> tags are different categorises which cointains there own metadata. The <tei header> offers a large possibility to encode and annotate a variety of elements and defines what they really represent in the text. 
One of the solutions that the TEI_all helps to resolve is the different lists I created. In the header, I could specify which one is for what. We do not get confused and can not mess up the elements between the <persName> and the <place>. With the DTD file, I feel stuck describing the metadata in the header without confusing it when I encode it. One problem we have with the TEI is the tags place like for example with dimensions of the book we could not use the specific tag in the body part so I have to use another tag less specific.
We could feel frustrated with the TEI because of all the rules we have to follow. The personalisation of the DTD could help to bring a little bit of freedom to encode the things in the way that we would.
